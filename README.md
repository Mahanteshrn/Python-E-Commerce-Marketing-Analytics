Discussion 

The good thing about eCommerce data is there’s lots of it: shopping cart activity, item sales, category trends, advertising performance, customer demographics, 
browsing and buying behavior… the list goes on. The bad thing about eCommerce data is – there’s lots of it. In some cases, it can be outright intimidating.
Nonetheless, when you manage to gather, visualize, and analyze all of your crucial eCommerce performance data, it becomes an unparalleled tool for growth. 
So, simply put, eCommerce analytics is the process of gathering all the different information related to your eCommerce business, primarily from your online store, 
and putting this data under a microscope.This process involves integrating all your data into one place, building dashboards and reports so you can display these 
results visually, and then analyzing this displayed data to gain actionable insights about your business. Why do we emphasize actionable insights? Well, a bunch of 
random numbers shown in a nicely designed dashboard won’t help you win more customers or earn more revenue. But, by understanding what these numbers are telling you,
you can make timely and effective decisions that will support the growth of your business.

For example, with the right data at our fingertips we can:

Understand which channels are bringing the most customers – and optimize your marketing budget and investments accordingly Learn which groups of customers spend the 
most and what they are spending their money on – and target them with specific offers Discover which customers are least likely to make a second purchase and why – 
and develop an appropriate customer retention strategy Most importantly, all of these insights will be based on real-life data, actual bits of information delivered 
by the platforms you are using. Basing your business decisions on hard numbers and facts instead of costly guesses and estimates puts you in a much better position, 
and gives the competitive edge over online retailers who don’t approach eCommerce analytics with the same level of seriousness.To achieve all of this, however, 
we first need to identify which metrics are the most crucial to eCommerce business.
